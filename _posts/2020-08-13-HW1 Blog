title: "What Being a Data Scientist is About"
---
Data science is about creating a crystal ball capable of answering complex questions before we can even think to ask them.  Granted that's a stretch but after reading the 
provided articles that may not too far off.  With the right mix of coding, statistical analysis, data management and product knowledge skills, data scientists 
might be on their way to building this crystal ball - or at least a prototype of it.  The engineers can take it to scale.

Taken individually, these skills are in decent supply. There are many strong software engineers, capable statisticians and product managers intimately familiar with their platforms.
So what most defines a data scientist? 

For me thee root of data science is a deep curiosity about behaviors and patterns and a desire to infuence them in real time. This curiosity drives data 
scientists to use whatever resources are available to improve their understanding of behaviors, how to better predict them and translate those predictions into complex problems
solved. The software, frameworks, academic theories, & interaction with other subject matter experts (e.g. statisticians, ML engineers) are necessary tools of the traid employed 
to satisfy this curiosity. 

The distinction between data science and statistics seems mostly technical and one of scope.  Data scientists work more commercially on larger real world data sets (largely unstructured)
with the goal of influencing consumer behaviors in near real time. Statisticians, on the other hand, design experiements, work on smaller data sets derived from these experiments
and use statistical methods to prove / disprove hypotheses.  On a personal level, too early to tell how I see myself in relation to these fields.  No dout ST558 will provide some
clarity.
