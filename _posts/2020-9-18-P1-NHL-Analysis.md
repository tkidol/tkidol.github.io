title: "NHL Analysis"
---
Pulling the NHL APIs & analyzing the data proved helpful.  There are a lot of takaways for me, primarily that practice makes perfect as I spent considerable time bug fixing & reading documentation.  All of that will prove useful for the next project no doubt.

[Here's the link to the Project 1 Repo.](https://github.com/tkidol/ST558-Project-1)

Looking back on lessons learned.  I found the data import & manipulation to straight forward.  There were a few issues with joining but those were relatively easily solved with concentration & document reading.  

My most significant issue was planning & structure.  I dove in & that led to a lot of re-work on conceptual ideas that I thought would prove useful but did not.  I deleted several code chunks & started concepts from scratch.  So I think diagraming & framing up from the end document back into the program structure & components needed would have helped a great deal.  Next time I will spend more time on the vision before diving into the coding.  

I found the R community to be very helpful & most of my questions were easily addressed in online saved chats.  All in all I think R is a strong tool & glad to be learning the fundamentals.  The projec significantly improved my grasp of how the analysis, visualizations & tools come together to produce easily consumed output.

All in all it was a fun project as a bona fide "Caniac".  It proved a great way to learn the material on a topic I enjoyed researching.
