title: "R vs Other Stats SW"
---
My only other experience with statistical SW is SAS 9.4.  Do I like R better?  At this point I'd say, "yes."  R seems more intuitive with simpler syntax / logic & 
extensible functionality due to the numerous R community packages available like "tidyverse".  As a new user, I seem to spend less time reading in & cleansing data which 
should leave more time for analyzing & reporting on the data - the real goal of using any stats software. 

I find Rstudio to be robust & user friendly.  The ability to combine yaml, plain text & code in the same mark down file is a nice bonus. The simplicity of commenting is also
a nice feature.  Options during file set up seem to make outputting consumable graphics to pdf, word & ppt (or similar open source equivalents) straight forward without any 
formatting surprises.

Processing speed, complex analytical & graphing capabilities are still untested. As is the need for OEM quality support due to an application issue.  Posting in an R forum 
may not be the best way to get tech support when an issue arises.

But, early on I like the R experience & would make it my default tool for data science.
