title: "Reflection on Initial Post"

The paragraph below is the conclusion to my original post.

*The distinction between data science and statistics seems mostly technical and one of scope.  Data scientists work more commercially on larger real world data sets (largely unstructured) with the goal of influencing consumer behaviors in near real time. Statisticians, on the other hand, design experiements, work on smaller data sets derived from these experiments and use statistical methods to prove / disprove hypotheses.  On a personal level, too early to tell how I see myself in relation to these fields.  No dout ST558 will provide some clarity.*

Refelcting on this idea as class concludes, I think it is mostly accurate.  I'd update to emphasize that data science uses statistical methods to "learn" about data & converts that knowledge into building models to make accurate predictions. So use cases extend well beyond the online consumer realm to anywhere data are being collected. Think internet of things where GE data scientists could analyze data streamed from refrigerators & predict failures before they happen or push an alert to a customer to recommend the most efficient time to run their dish washer. Or, infectioous disease experts analyzing Covid data to predict the next hot spot & inform local officials who can take actions to contain the outbreak.  Or, site reliability engineers (SRE's) at google using sophisiticated monitoring capabilities to predict failures, disign & implment auto-healing mechanisms which can be replicated globally to prevent failures or recover quickly from them without any human intervention.

Regarding R I'm a big fan.  As stated in a prior blog coding in R is very intuitive and the availability of packages to simplify data management, statistical analysis & reporting/sharing is a major advantage over commercial shelfware... & it's free.  It will definitely be my statistical tool of choice going forward.  

This class has made me think about statistics as something accessible to just about anyone.   It's not just limited to the realm of proving/disproving experiments and trials or infering how voters will vote from a polling sample.  Nope, with R & a little motivation, anyone can grab some data of interest, summarize variables / model predictions on them, build graphs / interactive websites & share what they've learned with anyone with web access and a browser.
